    <p>The next generation model of Sonos' Beam home cinema speaker will give you panoramic sound (with Dolby Atmos 3D effect) in a sleek and understated package. It's all been fine-tuned by Oscar-winning sound engineers, and the dedicated app will help you personalise the machine to your tastes (as well as hook up to other Sonos devices and play music).</p>

    <h2>Next is the sound burger</h2>

    <p>The Sound Burger is a portable vinyl record player that looks like an oversized hair straightener. It opens up like a clip where users can place a vinyl record. It's extremely compact compared to any other record player on the market, and the sound quality is worthy of Audio-Technica.</p>

    <h2>Then we have the Lumus Ar Lenses</h2>
